# virasset
Virasset is a system for Virtual Assessment of Taekwondo that uses artificial neural networks (DNN) to measure strokes in Taekwondo events.

## Intel Technologies
DevCloud, DPC++, Intel Iris Xe, Intel Iris Xe MAX, Intel Deep Link, Movidius NCS, OpenVINO, oneAPI

## Overview / Usage
Virasset uses artificial neural networks (DNN) with skeleton detection techniques to measure attack accuracy in Taekwondo events. Using the analysis of the body vertices with artificial intelligence, it is possible to estimate the position of all the members of the skeleton (elbow, knees and others), thus calculating the internal angles and a subsequent inference.

## Methodology / Approach
Like all points on the body, neural network inputs can estimate any position. Using Intel technology, this system can run on edge or cloud computers.

## Technologies Used
- OpenVINO
- Movidius
- OneAPI
- Realsense
- GPUs Iris Max e Iris XE Max
